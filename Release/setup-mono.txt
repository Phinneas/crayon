=== VERIFYING MONO ===

In order to run Crayon, you must have mono installed. To test if you have mono, open a bash shell
and type "mono" and see if usage notes are displayed. If you see "command not found", then you need
to install it: http://www.mono-project.com/download/


=== SETTING UP CRAYON ===

Once you have verified mono is ready, create a directory called Crayon in a location where you don't
mind for Crayon to reside.

For example, /Users/yourname/Crayon
I will use this directory as an example through the rest of this document. Any directory will do.

Copy the entire contents of this directory (where this file you are reading is) to /Users/yourname/Crayon

Edit your ~/.bash_profile file and add the following lines:

export CRAYON_HOME=/Users/yourname/Crayon
alias crayon='mono $CRAYON_HOME/crayon.exe'

Restart any bash shell windows you may have open.

To see if everything is working correctly, open a bash shell and type "crayon" (without quotes) 
and you should see usage notes.
